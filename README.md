# Plagiarism-text-matcher-checker
A simple text reuse detection CLI tool. Given a pair of texts or directories of texts, it will find similar text between them. 
The pilot experiment that uses this tool is allusion-detection. A new project that uses this tool is middlemarch-critical-histories.

Demo
Does Milton quote from the Bible in his Areopagitica? Letâ€™s find out.

$ text-matcher kjv.txt areopagitica.txt 

1 total matches found.

match 1:
kjv.txt: (4135539, 4135561) Spirit. 5:20 Despise not prophesyings Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 5:22 Abstain
areopagitica.txt: (25861, 25883) answerable to that of the Apostle to the Thessalonians PROVE ALL THINGS, HOLD FAST THAT WHICH IS GOOD. And he might
Usage
Just run text-matcher and provide the names of the text files you want to compare. You can also provide a directory of files instead of a single file, so if you want to compare textA.txt with every text file in textdir/, run text-matcher textA.txt textdir/.

You can also tweak the matching by providing the ngrams value to match against, and the threshold. From the help:

$ text-matcher --help
Usage: text-matcher [OPTIONS] TEXT1 TEXT2

  This program finds similar text in two text files.

Options:
  -t, --threshold INTEGER    The shortest length of match to include in the
                             list of initial matches.
  -c, --cutoff INTEGER       The shortest length of match to include in the
                             final list of extended matches.
  -n, --ngrams INTEGER       The ngram n-value to match against.
  -m, --mindistance INTEGER  The minimum value for distance between two
                             match.
  -l, --logfile TEXT         The name of the log file to write to.
  --stops                    Include stopwords in matching.
  --verbose                  Enable verbose mode, giving more information.
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
